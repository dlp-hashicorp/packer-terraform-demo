## HCP Packer and Terraform Demo in AWS

This repository contains the Packer and Terraform HCL definitions for a basic end-to-end demonstration in AWS.

### Pre-Requisites
- Create or access an existing Terraform Cloud Organization with "Team & Governance Plan" features enabled.
- Create an HCP Packer Registry with the "Plus" tier of service.
- Create a Service Principal for the target Organization in portal.cloud.hashicorp.com, Access Control (IAM).
  - Capture the Client ID and Secret
- Create a AWS IAM User and Access Keys with Admin privileges.
- Create a Variable Set in your Terraform Cloud Organization containing the following Environment variables: 
  - HCP_CLIENT_ID
  - HCP_CLIENT_SECRET (sensitive)
  - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (sensitive)
  - AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
- Create an "HCP-Packer" Run Task in your Terraform Cloud Organization
  - Retrieve the "Endpoint URL" and "HMAC Key" from the HCP Packer / "Integrate with Terraform Cloud" page under portal.cloud.hashicorp.com
- Create a Workspace in Terraform Cloud
- Assign the "HCP-Packer" Run Task to the target Workspace and configure it as *Mandatory*.
- Look for all instances of the string "UPDATEME" within this repository, and populate your appropriate AWS Region and Terraform Hostname/Organization/Workspace.
  - ```grep UPDATEME .```

### Base Image Build

This build uses a AWS Ubuntu image and installs Apache2 to serve as our organization's base image.

- ```cd packer-1-base```
- ```packer init .```
- ```HCP_PACKER_BUILD_FINGERPRINT="$(date +%s)" packer build acme-base.pkr.hcl```
- Create a *production* Channel for *acme-base*, and assign the built Iteration to it.

### Application Image Build

This build uses the production base image and deploys our application (creating an HTML file).

- ```cd packer-2-webapp```
- ```packer init .```
- ```HCP_PACKER_BUILD_FINGERPRINT="$(date +%s)" packer build acme-webapp.pkr.hcl```
- Create a *production* Channel for *acme-webapp*, and assign the built Iteration to it.

### Initial Application Deployment

Use Terraform to deploy a simple VPC and our application image.

- ```cd terraform```
- ```terraform init```
- ```terraform plan```
- ```terraform apply```
- View cat pictures in the URL output by Terraform.

### Revoke Vulnerable Images

Oh no!  A zero-day Apache2 vulnerability has reared it's ugly head and it will never be patched!

- Revoke the *acme-base* Iteration.
- Revoke the *acme-webapp* Iteration.
- ```terraform plan```
- ```terraform apply```
- Observe that the *HCP-Runtask* prevented the Revoked image from being deployed.

### Build Development Base Image

Let's replace Apache2 with Nginx to remediate the vulnerability.  We will build a new development base image so we can test the new image prior to a production deployment.

This build uses a AWS Ubuntu image and installs Nginx instead of Apache2.

- ```cd packer-3-base-update```
- ```packer init .```
- ```HCP_PACKER_BUILD_FINGERPRINT="$(date +%s)" packer build acme-base.pkr.hcl```
- Create a *development* Channel for *acme-base*, and assign the built Iteration to it.

### Build Development Application Image

This build uses the new development base image and deploys our application (creating an HTML file).

- ```cd packer-4-webapp-update```
- ```packer init .```
- ```HCP_PACKER_BUILD_FINGERPRINT="$(date +%s)" packer build acme-webapp.pkr.hcl```
- Create a *development* Channel for *acme-webapp*, and assign the built Iteration to it.

### Deploy Updated Development Application Image

Use Terraform to deploy the new development application image.

- ```cd terraform```
- Open *web_app.tf* in an editor.
  - Set Variable *hcp_channel* to *development*
- ```terraform plan```
- ```terraform apply```
- View cat pictures in the URL output by Terraform.

### Promote Development Images to Production

Testing has been completed and it is time to promote the development base image to production.

(This stage is not represented by distinct files in the demo code.)

- Update the *production* Iteration for *acme-base*, and assign the tested Iteration to it.
- Update *acme-webapp.pkr.hcl* and set *hcp_base_channel* to *production*.
- ```HCP_PACKER_BUILD_FINGERPRINT="$(date +%s)" packer build acme-webapp.pkr.hcl```
- Update *web_app.tf* and set *hcp_channel* to *production*.
- ```terraform plan```
- ```terraform apply```
- View cat pictures in the URL output by Terraform.
- Profit!
